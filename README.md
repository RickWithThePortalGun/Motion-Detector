A Motion detector script that accesses the available camera module and detect motion in the video stream. Made using OpenCV..
I'm having so much fun with python and going to add visualisations soo.. This visualisation will utilise the .csv file generated to produce a graph of recorded motions detected in the video streams..
I would like to thank and give credits to Ardit Sulce for helping me with project.. Check him out on UDEMY!
